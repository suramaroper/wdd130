    <h2>Surama Roper</h2>
    <h3>Su</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Surama Roper, I go by Su. I am originally from Recife, Brazil, but I have been living in US for the last twenty-one years. I love spending time with my family. My husband, Dan, and I will be celebrating our 20th anniversary in November, we have a set of almost 18 years old twins, boy and girl, and a 15 years old boy. We live in Utah.</p>
<p>I have been a member of the Church for almost 35 years, served in Ribeirão Preto (São Paulo) Brazil Mission, and graduated from the Federal University of Pernambuco with a degree in Languages (Portuguese/English). I now work fulltime as a Portuguese translator,but I am looking for a carreer change, so I started taking this class to see where it can take me.  </p>
<p>One of my favorites quotes is: "Stop finding excuses, start finding solutions". I don't know where that came from, but It is something that I have been quoting for a long time and it helps me to "be the solution", something that my mission president always said "You are the solution". I am excited to get to know you guys.</p>
